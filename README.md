# Description

Small extension to the awesome git plugin to aid me in my daily work.
* Adds a new command: GitAddAll
  (doing basically the same as GitAddChoice with all, including untracked files),
  but you can set a keyboard binding to it.

# Installation

Clone it into your Sublime Packages Folder.
